# Welcome

### Thank you for exploring S & D Simple News.

It is a web-based news application to simplify the news reading experience. It will scrape top Headlines of USA Today, Clarion Ledger, OnlineKhabar and KhasoKhas and give the bare news as an output.

This application is developed using Node.js, Express.js, Cheerio.js, HTML and CSS. The user interface is responsive and minimal.

**Feel free to Clone and Fork. Commercial Distribution is Prohibited.**

## Background (_Why this application was developed?_)

My Wife, Deepa, is trying to improve her English vocabulary. Instead of memorizing words, I suggested her to dedicate thirty minutes a day to read articles written in English. I believe, by doing so, she will also have a general idea of where and how to use the word. She started reading English news portals but was annoyed by the ads.

Nowadays, ads are everywhere and the struggle is real to find the core content from news portals. Being a bilingual person I prefer to follow news on both English and Nepali language. For that, I have to go through different webpages one at a time, scroll through titles to filter a readable content, and repeat. It is not a fun job to do.

Therefore, I decided to develop this application to scrape the popular news portals (according to me), grab the popular content, and display them all on one page.
